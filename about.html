										<h2 id="content">Quick Bio</h2>
										<p> I completed my PhD at Berkeley in Fall 2020 advised by Prof. Claire Tomlin. I also worked closely with Profs. Jitendra Malik, Anca Dragan, Sergey Levine, and Sanjit Seshia. Before that, I obtained my B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, and an M.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences from UC Berkeley in 2012 and 2014, respectively. After my masters, I worked as a Business Consultant for Applied Predictive Technologies for a year. I have also spent time as a research assistant in the autonomy team at Skydio.</p>

										<h2 id="content">Detailed Bio</h2>
										<p> I was born and grew up in India in a small town called Hanumangarh. I completed my PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at UC Berkeley, under the supervision of Prof. Claire Tomlin in the Hybrid Systems Laboratory. Before that, I completed my B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, and an M.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (advisor: Prof. Claire Tomlin) from UC Berkeley in 2012 and 2014, respectively. I have also spent time at University of Western Ontario as a research assistant, and with the performance verification team at Broadcom. After my masters, I worked as a Business Consultant for Applied Predictive Technologies at their San Francisco office. During my PhD, I have also worked as a research intern with the autonomy team at Skydio. 
										<br>
										<br>
										I am broadly interested in the intersection of control and dynamical system theory, machine learning, and computer vision for robotic applications. Specifically, I explore how machine learning tools can be combined with the control theoretic frameworks to develop data-efficient and safe learning-based control algorithms for physical robotic systems, especially when the system is operating in an uncertain environment. 
										<br>
										<br>
										In my free time, I enjoy climbing, hiking, playing board games, solving puzzles, and exploring new restaurants. I also write on Quora to share my own experience and thoughts on machine learning, control, and robotics <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Somil-Bansal">(my Quora profile).</a>
